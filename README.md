# Bloom Mum App

Open the `App.js` file for main modifications. You can preview the changes directly on your phone or tablet by scanning the **QR code** or use the iOS or Android emulators. When you're done, click **Save** and share the link!

note: (add all the files that ends with the word "screen" to sub-folder called "screens" and main folder called "src")

When you're ready to see everything that Expo provides (or if you want to use your own editor) you can **Download** your project and use it with [expo cli](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/#expo-cli)).
